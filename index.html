            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of
            the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of
            a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
            in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center
            — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth,
            if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not
            in theory.

            Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both
            good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early
            warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

            For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds
            and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly
            changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are
            far more valuable than those which divide us.

            As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
            size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful
            you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
            fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would
            crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
